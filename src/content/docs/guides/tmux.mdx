[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) is a tool that lets you run multiple tasks in one terminal, even in the background, so they keep running after you close the window.

## Installation

We will install tmux using [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/). Before proceeding, ensure that you have followed the [Pixi installation guide](../pixi/). Once Pixi is installed in your environment, you can install tmux globally by running:

```sh
pixi global install tmux
```
