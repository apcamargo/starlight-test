[Pixi](https://pixi.sh/) is a package manager to install packages from the Conda ecosystem.

## Installation

<Steps>

1. To install Pixi run the following command in your terminal:

    ```sh
    curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash
    ```

2. By default, Pixi retrieves packages only from [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/). However, since most bioinformatics software is available on [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/), we will add it as an additional repository:

    ```sh
    pixi config append --global default-channels conda-forge
    pixi config append --global default-channels bioconda
    ```

</Steps>

## Installing global tools

Pixi allows you to install software globally, eliminating the need to create and activate environments. Since Pixi isolates each tool from the rest, you don't need to worry about potentially conflicting dependencies.

For example, if you want to install [SeqKit](https://github.com/shenwei356/seqkit) you can run:

```sh
pixi global install seqkit
```

After installation, the `seqkit` command will be available to you.

```sh
seqkit --help
```
