## Piping and redirecting

Piping and redirecting are fundamental concepts in Linux that allow you to control how data flows between commands and files. They make the command line incredibly powerful by enabling you to chain commands together and manage input/output streams.

### Standard streams

Before diving in, understand the three standard streams:

- **stdin:** Data flows *into* a program.
- **stdout:** Data flows *out of* a program.
- **stderr:** Error messages flow *out of* a program separately.

### Piping

The pipe operator `|` connects the stdout of one command to the stdin of another command.

```sh "|" title="Counting entries in a FASTA file"
awk '/^>/' genome.fasta | wc -l
```

```sh "|"
# ls writes to stdout → grep reads from stdin
ls -la | grep ".txt"

# cat writes file content to stdout → wc reads from stdin
cat file.txt | wc -l

# Multiple pipes create a pipeline
ps aux | grep firefox | awk '{print $2}'
#      ↑              ↑
#     stdout→stdin   stdout→stdin
```

### Redirecting

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `>` | Redirect output to file (overwrite) | `echo "Hello" > file.txt` |
| `>>` | Redirect output to file (append) | `echo "World" >> file.txt` |
| `2>` | Redirect errors to file | `command 2> errors.log` |
| `&>` | Redirect both output and errors | `command &> all.log` |
| `2>&1` | Merge error stream (stderr → stdout) | `command > /dev/null 2>&1` |
| `<` | Read input from file | `sort < names.txt` |

### Process substitution

```sh /<\(([^)]*)\)/
# Treat command output as a file for stdin
diff <(ls dir1) <(ls dir2)
#     ↑          ↑
# stdout→temp   stdout→temp
# Both temps become stdin for diff
```

    CMD1("Command 1")
    CMD2("Command 2")
    TERM("Terminal")
    
    CMD1 -->|"stdout"| PIPE("|")
    PIPE -->|"stdin"| CMD2
    CMD1 -->|"stderr"| TERM
```

### Common combinations

```sh "|" ">" "2>" "2>&1"
cat file.txt | sort | uniq > sorted.txt
command 2>&1 | tee output.log
find . -name "*.log" 2> /dev/null
```
