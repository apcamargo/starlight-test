## Piping and redirecting

Piping and redirecting are fundamental concepts in Linux that allow you to control how data flows between commands and files. They make the command line incredibly powerful by enabling you to chain commands together and manage input/output streams.

### Standard streams

- **stdin:** Data flows *into* a program.
- **stdout:** Data flows *out of* a program.
- **stderr:** Error messages flow *out of* a program separately.

```mermaid
graph LR
    INPUT["Data sources"]
    
    subgraph PROGRAM["Process"]
        STDIN["stdin"] --> PROC["🖥️"] 
        PROC --> STDOUT["stdout"]
        PROC --> STDERR["stderr"]
    end
    
    OUTPUT["Data destinations"]
    
    INPUT --> STDIN
    STDOUT --> OUTPUT
    STDERR --> OUTPUT
```


### Piping

The pipe operator `|` connects the stdout of one command to the stdin of another command.

```mermaid
graph LR
    CMD1("Command 1")
    CMD2("Command 2")
    TERM("Terminal")
    
    CMD1 -->|"stdout"| PIPE("|")
    PIPE -->|"stdin"| CMD2
    CMD1 -->|"stderr"| TERM
```

```sh "|" title="Counting entries in a FASTA file"
awk '/^>/' genome.fasta | wc -l
```

```sh "|"
# ls writes to stdout → grep reads from stdin
ls -la | grep ".txt"

# cat writes file content to stdout → wc reads from stdin
cat file.txt | wc -l

# Multiple pipes create a pipeline
ps aux | grep firefox | awk '{print $2}'
#      ↑              ↑
#     stdout→stdin   stdout→stdin
```

### Redirecting

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `>` | Redirect output to file (overwrite) | `echo "Hello" > file.txt` |
| `>>` | Redirect output to file (append) | `echo "World" >> file.txt` |
| `2>` | Redirect errors to file | `command 2> errors.log` |
| `&>` | Redirect both output and errors | `command &> all.log` |
| `2>&1` | Merge error stream (stderr → stdout) | `command > /dev/null 2>&1` |
| `<` | Read input from file | `sort < names.txt` |

### Common combinations

```sh "|" ">" "2>" "2>&1"
cat file.txt | sort | uniq > sorted.txt
command 2>&1 | tee output.log
find . -name "*.log" 2> /dev/null
```

### The `sponge` command

When you redirect output back to the same file you're reading from, the operation fails in an unexpected way. Consider this example where you want to sort sequences in a FASTA file by length using [SeqKit](https://bioinf.shenwei.me/seqkit) and save the result back to the same file:

```sh
seqkit sort -l sequences.fasta > sequences.fasta
```

This command empties `file.txt` completely. The `>` operator clears the file to prepare for writing before `sort` gets a chance to read it, resulting in total data loss.

The `sponge` command solves this problem by reading everything first, then writing to the file:

```sh
seqkit sort -l sequences.fasta | sponge sequences.fasta
```

Since `sponge` isn't included in standard Linux installations, you'll need to install it through the [`moreutils`](https://joeyh.name/code/moreutils/) package. Using [Pixi](../pixi/):

```sh
pixi global install moreutils
```

The `moreutils` package includes `sponge` along with several other handy command-line tools.

### Process substitution

```sh /\<\x28[^\x29]*\x29/
# Treat command output as a file for stdin
diff <(ls dir1) <(ls dir2)
#    ↑          ↑
# stdout→temp   stdout→temp
# Both temps become stdin for diff
```
